It was a ruse all along!","text":"<p>Yes, that\u2019s right, I have a gift for you. For the past several months, I have been secretly working on a way to organize our recipes. I have made this website so that it is easy for us to access them.</p> <p>I have tried my best to make this project suit our needs. For me, I have created an index for each ingredient (because sometimes with depression I have no idea what to make). But for you, that amount of inspiration would be a big distraction! So I have also added a toggle button on the top right to hide those hyperlinks. The recipe pages themselves are sparse on purpose to avoid distractions and make it easy to cook with. I also tried to make the font easy to read. Of course, there are limits to what I can do without your input. I am so excited to be finally sharing this project with you.</p> <p>More importantly though, this project is an anniversary gift to you because it represents our commitment to being a team and working together. Now, I don\u2019t have to ask you for a list of ingredients every time you say you want to make a Ruhama dish. This is a personal website for us. We can add pictures! And notes of good memories! You will also find tabs for Savta Naomi and Grandma Naomi. I hope that the work I have put in so far has set us up well for using this website for many, many years to come.</p> <p>Lots of love, Aviva</p>"},{"location":"ingredients/index.html","title":"Ingredients","text":""},{"location":"ingredients/index.html#agave","title":"Agave","text":""},{"location":"ingredients/index.html#curry-noodle-soup-recipe","title":"Curry

Stir until they\u2019re coated in the onion-flavored oil, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.</li> <li>Parboil the rice. Set a large non-stick pot, over high heat. Add 8 cups of water and the salt and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the rice and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until the rice is slightly softened but still firm. Drain through a fine mesh strainer, then stir the parboiled rice into the cinnamon-spiced lentils. Rinse out the pot you cooked the rice in and return it to the stove.</li> <li>Prepare the tahdig layer. To a medium mixing bowl, add 1 cup of the cooked rice and lentil mixture and 1 tablespoon of the bloomed saffron water. Stir very gently until the rice turns golden.</li> <li>Crisp the tahdig layer. Pour the neutral oil into the pot you used to cook the rice, but do not turn on the heat yet. Add the saffron rice and lentil mixture and use the back of a spoon to push into a flat layer all across the pot.</li> <li>Layer the rice. Add the remaining rice mixture (you don\u2019t need to press this layer down). Next, scatter the caramelized onions on top, then the raisins, dates and a drizzle of the remaining saffron water. Use the end of a spoon to poke 5 holes evenly across the rice from top to bottom.</li> <li>Steam the rice. Put a lid on the saucepan and turn heat to high. Once steam starts to rise, reduce heat to low\u2013ideally you have a glass lid, but if not this should take about 5 minutes. Keep a close eye on the pot to avoid burning the tahdig. Wrap a tea-towel around the lid, and place it back on the pot. Continue to cook for 1 hour, covered over low heat to allow the rice to steam.</li> <li>Serve the rice. Remove the lid, gently fluff the rice to mix, then spoon into a serving dish. Use a spatula to get under the edges of the crispy tahdig layer, then carefully lift it out of the pot. Serve the crispy tahdig in a separate dish in one piece, or break up and place around the edge of the rice.</li> </ol> <p>https://www.themediterraneandish.com/adas-polo-rice-and-lentils-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-85047</p>"},{"location":"recipes/apple_cake_ruhama.html","title":"Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Apple Cake","text":"<p>You must try this one-bowl, easy to prepare, gluten-free, and dairy-free delicious apple cake!

(Higher heat = more caramelization, more quickly.) Remove bottom 2\" of tough stem from 1 head of broccoli with a chef\u2019s knife; discard. Cut broccoli crosswise, starting with the stem end (yep, you can eat most of the stem!) into \u00bc\" slices. When you reach the crown, slow your slicing so you can push the florets to the side as they begin to fall with each slice. You want to have lots of loose florets. No matter what kinds of veggies you're roasting, you want to cut them into pieces that are about the same size so that they cook at the same(ish) rate.</p> <p>Transfer broccoli to a rimmed baking sheet. (If you don't have a proper, heavy-duty aluminum half sheet pan, this is a reminder to invest in one ASAP.) Drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil; season with 1 tsp. salt and toss to coat. If you were interested in adding any spices\u2014think curry powder, chile flakes, fennel seeds\u2014this is the time to do it.</p> <p>Arrange broccoli on pan in a single layer, spacing so no pieces overlap (this ensures broccoli will roast properly, not just steam). Roast until nicely browned, even charred in spots, and crispy with a bright green interior, 8\u201310 minutes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, make your tahini sauce. Cut 1 lemon in half. Using a citrus juicer (or your hands), juice lemon (fish out any seeds) into a small bowl. Cut remaining 1 lemon into wedges; set aside for serving. Peel 1 garlic clove and use a Microplane to grate it into bowl with lemon juice. (We're big fans of grated garlic over here, especially when it comes to dressings and sauces. It's a hell of a lot easier than trying to get a fine, even mince with a knife, and there's no risk of biting into a big chunk of raw garlic later on.)</p> <p>Add 5 Tbsp. tahini, 1 Tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp. salt, and \u00bc cup hot water and whisk until smooth. Give it a taste: The richness of the tahini and zippiness from the lemon should be nicely balanced, so adjust with more of either if necessary, and don't be afraid to add more salt if the sauce doesn't pop.</p> <p>Gently toss broccoli by giving pan a shake (or use a spatula). Continue to roast until browned in spots and tender, 5\u20138 minutes longer. As with all recipes, the amount of time it takes is going to have a lot to do with the equipment you're using\u2014you want that broccoli to have plenty of color on it, so don't be afraid to keep roasting until you get there.</p> <p>Heat a small skillet over medium. Toast 2 Tbsp. sesame seeds, tossing frequently, until light golden and slightly fragrant, about 2 minutes. Don\u2019t walk away; the seeds will burn quickly! Let cool. (And, FWIW, this recipe will still be good if you skipped the sesame seeds\u2014but if you're going to use them, make sure to toast them, which will make them a lot more flavorful. Cool?)</p> <p>Transfer broccoli to a platter and drizzle with tahini sauce. Top with sesame seeds and reserved lemon wedges for squeezing over. One of the great things about roasted vegetables is that they're just as delicious room temperature as they are piping hot, so don't stress if the rest of dinner isn't ready yet.</p> <p>https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/crispy-roasted-broccoli-with-tahini-sauce?intcid=inline_amp</p>"},{"location":"recipes/croutons.html","title":"Torn Croutons","text":"<p>My favorite use for leftover challah.</p> <p>carbohydrate, condiment, pareve, freezable</p>"},{"location":"recipes/croutons.html#ingredients","title":"Ingredients","text":"<ul> <li>leftover challah or other bread (1 pound will make 8 cups of croutons)</li> <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li> </ul>"},{"location":"recipes/croutons.html#instructions","title":"Instructions","text":"<p>Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.

Every bite of this outrageous cookie reveals layers of decadence that boast an irresistible combination of chewiness, a delightful balance of salty-sweet notes, and a deep chocolate richness that will leave you reaching for seconds (and thirds!). The secret lies in four specific ingredients: browned butter, egg yolk, chocolate, and espresso powder. Browned butter contributes notes of nuttiness that elevate the flavor, while an extra egg yolk ensures a lusciously rich, chewy texture. A combination of dark and semisweet chocolate adds the final touch of indulgence, while espresso powder intensifies the chocolate flavor. </p> <p></p> <p>dessert, dairy, carbohydrate</p> <p>18 cookies</p> <ul> <li>1 cup bread flour</li> <li>\u00be cup all-purpose flour</li> <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or 1\u00bd teaspoons table salt</li> <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li> <li>1 cup unsalted butter, 2 sticks</li> <li>2 tablespoons water, room temperature</li> <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li> <li>\u00bd cup white sugar</li> <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li> <li>1 teaspoon espresso powder</li> <li>1 large egg</li> <li>1 large egg yolk</li> <li>\u00bd cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li> <li>5 oz dark chocolate, chopped</li> </ul> <p>In a medium bowl, sift together the flours, salt, and baking soda. Set aside.</p> <p>In a medium or large saucepan, add the butter and melt over medium heat. The larger the pan you use, the quicker the process will be!</p> <p>Bring the butter to a boil, stirring frequently. As the water begins to boil out of the butter, the milk solids in the butter will separate, sink to the bottom, and begin to toast and brown. As this begins to happen, make sure to stir constantly so the butter browns evenly. It may become quite foamy, splatter a bit, and be difficult to see, so keep a close eye on it, removing from heat and continuing to stir if it starts to foam over.</p> <p>Once the butter has turned a nice nutty brown, remove from the heat and pour into a large liquid measuring cup to stop the cooking. Allow it to cool down for a minute or two, give it a stir, and carefully add 2-3 tablespoons of water to the butter to bring it back up to 1 cup (240 ml) of liquid.</p> <p>Set aside to cool to room temperature. To help speed this process up, you can place in the fridge for 10-15 minutes. You want to make sure the butter is still liquid when you\u2019re adding it to the dough later on, so make sure to remove after 15 minutes.</p> <p>In a large bowl, add the sugars, vanilla, espresso powder, and cooled brown butter. Cream together with an electric hand mixer until light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes.</p> <p>Add the egg and yolk and beat until incorporated.</p> <p>Add the dry ingredients, about \u2153 of the mixture at a time, and beat between additions until just incorporated.
